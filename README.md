# OPTIMIZING-WASTE-MANAGEMENT-WITH-IOT-BOOSTING-EFFICIENCY-AND-PROMOTING-SUSTAINABILITY
This study suggests smart trash cans that are based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and can observe the system. The trash reception as of right now. Both individuals and corporations produce waste, but in order to safeguard
the environment and the general public's health, the disposal of that waste must be handled. Putting in place
efficient waste management systems is necessary for the creation of livable and sustainable cities. In this
situation, recycling is a helpful waste management strategy that can be applied. In the present traditional
method, trash disposal and monitoring are done by people, which is laborious. Waste bin monitoring will
becoming easier with IoT integration into the current system. This study's objectives are to investigate the
Internet of Things and offer an architecture for an Internet of Things-based smart city's smart waste
management system. Our goal is to demonstrate how IoT may be utilized to handle and manage waste in smart
cities, hence addressing concerns related to scalability and adaption. The recommended approach makes use of
ultrasonic sensors to communicate the waste's condition to the garbage can and estimate its trash volume. The
server will SMS the appropriate people via the global standard for mobile phones (GSM). These smart trash
cans were created using ARDUINO UNO, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, LCD display, Blynk software, and
battery jumper cables. All connections between hardware and software have already been made, and the smart
waste cleanup program has been correctly operated. The trash can lid is designed to wait for the user to place
the garbage can inside, and it will close when they leave. We aim to make it affordably priced for the majority of
people, both from a business and environmental perspective. It promotes green practices and cleanliness.
